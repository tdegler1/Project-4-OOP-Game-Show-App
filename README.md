# Project-4-OOP-Game-Show-App
This is a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter."
It uses JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase. A player tries to guess the phrase by selecting individual letters from an onscreen keyboard before running  out of attempts.
